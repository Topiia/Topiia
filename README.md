💫 About Me

I am a web developer focused on debugging, stabilizing, and optimizing frontend applications, with backend support when required.

I work primarily with JavaScript and React, handling real-world issues such as UI bugs, broken state flows, performance bottlenecks, and unreliable real-time updates. I also work with Python backends to diagnose and fix issues that directly impact frontend behavior, including API responses, async flows, and WebSocket connections.

My current focus is on code reliability, long-running application stability, and production-style bug fixing, ensuring applications behave predictably under real usage conditions.
